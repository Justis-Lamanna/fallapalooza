# Fallapalooza
Backend code POC for Fallapalooza UI

This project is to allow for more convenient handling of Fallapalooza data for future tournaments. Fallapalooza happened on December 12th-13th, 2020, 
and was run on a Google Sheets page with a manual program to parse the spreadsheet. My goal is to improve this process with a proper backend, which will
allow for near-complete automation from both the player and the admin side.

The front-end will be provided in a seperate repository.
